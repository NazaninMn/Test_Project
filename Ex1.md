# Reproducible Research

Reproducibility is the closeness of the agreement between the results of measurements of the same measurand carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal)[1]. Reproducibility can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same measurand—to check that the results are not an artefact of the measurement procedures.[2]
A related concept is replication, which is the ability to independently achieve non-identical conclusions that are at least similar, when differences in sampling, research procedures and data analysis methods may exist.[3]
