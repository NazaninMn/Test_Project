  abstract = {Increased capability for milk production has been associated with a decline in fertility of lactating cows. Nutritional requirements increase rapidly with milk production after calving and result in negative energy balance (NEBAL). NEBAL delays the time of first ovulation through inhibition of LH pulse frequency and low levels of blood glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) that collectively restrain estrogen production by dominant follicles. Up-regulation of LH pulses and peripheral IGF-I in association with the NEBAL nadir facilitates ovulation. NEBAL reduces serum progesterone concentrations and fertility. Diets high in crude protein support high milk yield, but are also associated with lower reproductive performance. High protein can result in elevated plasma urea concentrations that affect the uterine environment and fertility. Nutritional interactions resulting in poor fertility of high producing dairy cows include the antecedent effects of NEBAL and effects of high dietary protein.},

  abstract = {The ecology of hydrocarbon degradation by microbial populations in the natural environment is reviewed, emphasizing the physical, chemical, and biological factors that contribute to the biodegradation of petroleum and individual hydrocarbons. Rates of biodegradation depend greatly on the composition, state, and concentration of the oil or hydrocarbons, with dispersion and emulsification enhancing rates in aquatic systems and absorption by soil particulates being the key feature of terrestrial ecosystems. Temperature and oxygen and nutrient concentrations are important variables in both types of environments. Salinity and pressure may also affect biodegradation rates in some aquatic environments, and moisture and pH may limit biodegradation in soils. Hydrocarbons are degraded primarily by bacteria and fungi. Adaptation by prior exposure of microbial communities to hydrocarbons increases hydrocarbon degradation rates. Adaptation is brought about by selective enrichment of hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms and amplification of the pool of hydrocarbon-catabolizing genes. The latter phenomenon can now be monitored through the use of DNA probes. Increases in plasmid frequency may also be associated with genetic adaptation. Seeding to accelerate rates of biodegradation has been shown to be effective in some cases, particularly when used under controlled conditions, such as in fermentors or chemostats.},

  abstract = {Computers are a central tool in the research process, enabling complex and large-scale data analysis. As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},
